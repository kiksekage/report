\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Task}
The task to be solved is the SemEval-2018 Task 1: Affect in Tweets, and can be found on \hyperref[https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17333]{https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17333}. The task is split into five subtasks:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item EI-reg (Given a tweet and an emotion E, determine the  intensity of E that best represents the mental state of the tweeter—a real-valued score between 0 (least E) and 1 (most E).)
\item EI-oc (Given a tweet and an emotion E, classify the tweet into one of four ordinal classes of intensity of E that best represents the mental state of the tweeter.)
\item V-reg (Given a tweet, determine the intensity of sentiment or valence (V) that best represents the mental state of the tweeter—a real-valued score between 0 (most negative) and 1 (most positive).)
\item V-oc (Given a tweet, classify it into one of seven ordinal classes, corresponding to various levels of positive and negative sentiment intensity, that best represents the mental state of the tweeter.)
\item E-c (Given a tweet, classify it as 'neutral or no emotion' or as one, or more, of eleven given emotions that best represent the mental state of the tweeter.)
\end{enumerate}

For all of these subtasks, three language subsubtasks are present, for english, spanish and arabic.\\
