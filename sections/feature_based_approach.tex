\section{Feature based approach}

For the feature based approach, a feature extraction is done with regards to the term frequency - inverse document frequency. This has been the golden standard [CITE, speach and language processing page 278] for feature extraction, and ensures that the features extracted have the highest descriptive effect with regards to the tweets in which the feature occurs versus the tweets in which the feature does not. These extracted features are then used for the training of one of three different models, a nearest centroid classifier or perceptron for classification, or a random forest regressor for regression.\\
The three models all share the same general feature extraction, so they can be made directly comparable if the extraction parameters are kept comparatively the same.
