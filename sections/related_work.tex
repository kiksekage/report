\subsection{Semantic analysis RIGTIGE ORD?}

Semantic analysis and Twitter have been combined before. The SemEval tasks this PAPER and models attempt to solve have been tried before and a lot of different approaches and general task overview have been outlined in \cite{wassa2017}, which is written by the creators of the task.\\
The winning team of the SemEval EmoInt 2017, Prayas, have tackled a similar task as the regression task (task 1, in this paper). The winning system utilized an ensemble approach consisting of 5 sub models and using a weighted average of these models to come up with the final result \cite{prayas}. This model is utilizing most of the different approaches mentioned in the literature and combining them into one and with great success. The model presented in this PAPER will test out a simpler method and the influence of different hyperparameters and their direct correlation with the output scores of the model.\\
The runner up in the SemEval, \cite{ims}, used a, comparatively, simpler model consisting of a CNN-LSTM neural network which bears resemblance to the model presented in this PAPER, although using lexicons and training their model on singular emotions (anger, fear, joy or sadness) instead of the one-hit approach used in the model presented in this PAPER.\\
